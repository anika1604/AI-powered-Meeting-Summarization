ðŸ—£ Brian:
"Alright, everyone, letâ€™s get started. First offâ€”howâ€™s everyone doing? Steve, Chris, did you guys survive Monday?"

ðŸ—£ Steve:
"Man, barely! I woke up and immediately regretted all my weekend choices. But yeah, Iâ€™m here. Chris, how about you?"

ðŸ—£ Chris:
"Oh, same here. I stayed up way too late gaming last night. My sleep schedule is a disaster at this point."

ðŸ—£ Brian:
"sighs I donâ€™t know why I expected anything different from you two. Anyway, letâ€™s get to work before this turns into a therapy session."

ðŸ—£ Brian:
"now, letâ€™s go over our progress. Steve, can you update us on the frontend work?"

ðŸ—£ Steve:
"Sure! So, the homepage UI is almost complete, but I still need to fix some responsiveness issues. Also, I was trying out a new font style, but I think we should discuss if we want to change it. Chris, Iâ€™ll need some API endpoints soon so I can integrate authentication."

ðŸ—£ Brian:
"Sounds good, Steve. Try to finalize those fixes by Friday. Chris, howâ€™s backend development going?"

ðŸ—£ Chris:
"Not bad! Iâ€™ve completed the database schema, and the user authentication API is 80% done. I just need to test it. Also, Steve, I saw your UI designâ€”looking sleek! But letâ€™s make sure it aligns with the backend structure. Iâ€™ll send you the API documentation by tomorrow."

ðŸ—£ Steve:
"Appreciate it, Chris! And yeah, Iâ€™ll review the docs once you send them."

ðŸ—£ Brian:
"Awesome! By the way, have either of you tested the site on mobile yet?"

ðŸ—£ Steve:
"Yeah, I did a quick test. It looks fine on most devices, but some buttons get misaligned on smaller screens."

ðŸ—£ Chris:
"Wait, I thought we agreed to make it responsive from the start? Steve, donâ€™t make me write an extra API just to fix your buttons."

ðŸ—£ Steve:
"laughs Chill, Chris, Iâ€™m on it! Itâ€™ll be fixed by tomorrow."
