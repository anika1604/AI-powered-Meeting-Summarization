Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They want me to act as a meeting summarizer API that generates a JSON summary. The user provided a conversation between Alex and Emma about planning a team-building outing. 

First, I should parse the conversation. They discussed organizing a team-building activity, specifically bowling night, with a budget under $300. They also talked about sending out invites and aiming for next Friday.

The user specified the JSON schema: {"summary": "", "todo_work": [{"assignee": "", "work": [""]}]}. I need to strictly follow this without adding extra keys.

For the summary, I'll condense the main points: deciding on bowling, budget, venue, invite, and RSVPs. 

Next, the todo_work section. Assignees are Alex and Emma. Alex needs to check local spots and send options. Emma has to create the invite, send it, confirm the spot, and handle RSVPs.

I should structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each task is listed under the correct assignee. No extra keys, just what's specified.

I should also make sure the JSON is properly formatted and valid. Let me double-check the structure to avoid any mistakes. 

Finally, I'll present the JSON as the response, keeping it clean and only including the necessary keys as per the user's instructions.
